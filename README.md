The OctoPrint-Plugin manages all spool information and stores it in a database.

## Fork notice

Due to long period of inactivity, issues & pull requests neglect by @OllisGit on the original repository ([OllisGit/OctoPrint-SpoolManager](https://github.com/OllisGit/OctoPrint-SpoolManager), see eg. [issue 333](https://github.com/OllisGit/OctoPrint-SpoolManager/issues/333)), I, @mdziekon, have decided to fork the repo & continue working on the plugin, mostly due to noticed inconveniences I could fix to improve my own user experience.

Right now, this fork has not been registered officially at [plugins.octoprint.org](https://plugins.octoprint.org/), and I have not requested any take-over action, however this might change in the future if the community decides this would be a sensible way to go forward.

For now, I do not plan to continue any "planned features" work from the original maintainer's backlog (such as remote database support), but focus on bug fixing, code refactoring & minor UX improvements. However, all pull requests bringing work outside of my current area of interest are still welcome - I'll at least try to provide some feedback, and merge in cases where my limited Python ecosystem knowledge is sufficient to ensure plugin's healthy operation.

If you wish to support the original maintainer, or find any legacy information about the plugin, go to [OllisGit/OctoPrint-SpoolManager](https://github.com/OllisGit/OctoPrint-SpoolManager).

## Setup
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/mdziekon/OctoPrint-SpoolManager/releases/latest/download/master.zip

After installation, you can listen on three release channels (since 1.6.0).
What does this mean: Each channel has its own release-version and each release has a different kind of functionality and stability.

- **"Only Release"**
  Only stable and tested versions will be shown in the software-update section of OctoPrint
- **"Release & Candidate"**
  Beside the stable release, you can also see the "release-candidates", like ``1.7.0rc3``.
  The RC's include new functionality/bugfixes and are already tested by the community...
- **"Release & Candidate & under Development"**
  Beside stable and rc, you will be informed about development versions.
  A development version like ``1.8.0.dev5`` could include a new (experimental) feature/bugfixes, but it is not fully tested by the community

Changing between each release is done via the "Software Update section" in the settings.

Hint: "Easy-switching" is possible with OctoPrint-Version 1.8.0 (see https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4238).
At the meantime you need to uninstall and install the version you like from the selected channel...or stay in one channel ;-)

## Versions

See [Releases](https://github.com/mdziekon/OctoPrint-SpoolManager/releases/)

# Development

## Events
Plugin sends the following custom events to the eventbus like this:

    eventManager().fire(eventKey, eventPayload)

| EventKeys                            |
| ------------------------------------ |
| plugin_spoolmanager_spool_weight_updated_after_print |
| plugin_spoolmanager_spool_selected |
| plugin_spoolmanager_spool_deselected |
| plugin_spoolmanager_spool_added |
| plugin_spoolmanager_spool_deleted |

### MQTT

When using [MQTT Plugin](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-MQTT) you can subscribe to the events mentioned above using following topic pattern:
```
octoPrint/event/<event_key>
```

Topic example:
```
octoPrint/event/plugin_spoolmanager_spool_deselected
```

### Event payloads

``spool_added``
``spool_selected``

```javascript
 {
   'databaseId': 23,
   'toolId': 1,
   'spoolName':'Fancy Spool',
   'material':'ABS',
   'colorName':'dark red',
   'remainingWeight': 1234
 }
```

``spool_deselected``

```javascript
 {
   'toolId': 1
 }
```

``spool_deleted``

```javascript
 {
   'databaseId': 23
 }
```

### Octoprint plugins ecosystem

Other Plugins could listen to this events in there python-code like this:

    eventmanager.subscribe("plugin_spoolmanager_spool_selected", self._myEventListener)

or use `octoprint.plugin.EventHandlerPlugin` with something like this:

    def on_event(self, event, payload):
        if event == "plugin_spoolmanager_spool_selected":
            ## do something usefull
