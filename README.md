The OctoPrint-Plugin manages all spool informations and stores it in a database.

#### Support my Efforts

This plugin, as well as my [other plugins](https://github.com/OllisGit/) were developed in my spare time.
If you like it, I would be thankful about a cup of coffee :)

## Setup
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/OllisGit/OctoPrint-SpoolManager/releases/latest/download/master.zip

After installation, you can listen on three release channels (since 1.6.0).
What does this mean: Each channel has its own release-version and each release has a different kind of functionality and stability.

- **"Only Release"**: Only stable and tested versions will be shown in the software-update section of OctoPrint
- **"Release & Candidate"**: Beside the stable release, you can also see the "release-candidates", like '''1.7.0rc3'''.
  The rc's includde new functionalty/bugfixes and are already tested by the community.. so by YOU ;-)
- **"Release & Candidate & under Development"**: Beside stable and rc, you will be informed about development versions.
  A development version like '''1.8.0.dev5``` could include a new (experimental) feature/bugfixs, but it is not fully tested by the community

Changing between each release is done via the "Software Update section" in the settings.

Hint: "Easy-switching" is possible with OctoPrint-Version 1.8.0 (see https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4238).
At the meantime you need to uninstall and install the version you like from the selected channel...or stay in one channel ;-)

HINT: In combination with the [MQTT Plugin](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-MQTT) you can subscribe e.g. to this topic:
```
octoPrint/event/plugin_spoolmanager_spool_deselected
```
